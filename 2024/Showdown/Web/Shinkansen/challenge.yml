hints:
  - The functions of parsing numbers are known to be really vulnerable in javascript. The question is how? On top of that you can use strings hehe. 
  - The function parseFloat is known to return exponential values when the input is too large. But what if output is passed to parseInt function???
  - There's a hidden input var in /execute endpoint... Maybe get some glassess like me to see it?
