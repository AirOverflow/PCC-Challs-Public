hints:
  - You can mess with the input of `JSON.parse`. I know you know it already. But it is what it is. 
  - The `host` and `hostname` are 2 separate fields returned by the `parse` object.
  - Did you know that a url without scheme and path is still a complete valid url? Now write the script FASTTTTTTT!!!. Cause you are running out of time.
