  TheFlash2k modified an already existing plugin to cater our needs.

  Someone else did the same; copy the code, the commit messages and `git push`.

  Here's all you need: [Challenge Repo](https://github.com/theflash2k/containers)

  You need to find the username who copied the actual code along with the commit hash where *due* credits were given.
