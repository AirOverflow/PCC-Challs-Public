    My friend Ali recently bought a new car, but he has been missing since last week.
    I want to file a police report to track him, as I fear he may have been kidnapped.
    Unfortunately, I don’t have any details about his car. Ali has always been passionate about
    hardware hacking, and I’m certain he would have tried hacking his new car.
    I was right—when I visited his home, I found a strange file on his laptop.
    To be honest, I have no idea what this file is,
    but I’m sure you can help me extract the details from it.

    Brand Of His Car 
    Name 
    Model
    Transmission (Auto/Man)


    Flag format is: `PCC{brand_name_model_transmission}`
